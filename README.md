Air quality monitoring system.

Air Quality Monitor(AQM) is a portable air pollution measurement system, using a microcontroller, which includes gas sensor(for gases CO, CO2, NH4, Ethanol, Acetone, Toluene) and dust sensors. We have collected data and updated into a database on a local server. Data can be viewed as tabular and graphical form in website created for the system.

 Features
•	It can calculate concentrations of gases (CO2, NH4 , CO, Toluene, Acetone, Ethanol) and dust particles in the air.
•	Data are sorted according to time of storage and displayed in tabular as well as graphical form.

Hardware Components Used: 
• Arduino
• MQ-135
• GP2Y1010AUOF
• Ethernet Shield
• LCD Display
